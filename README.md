# hello-world
Starting down a new path in life.
I decided it was time to make some changes and really start working to making the most out of this one life that we have to live. Oppertunies won't always present themselves, sometimes you have to make your own path. 
I enjoy gaming, streamning, storyboards, graphic designing, and many other aspects of the technological world. 
It's my goal to bring a lot of my ideas to life i.e. games, characters, and stories.
